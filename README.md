# Change-detection-in-Satelitte-Imagery
This project focuses on binary change detection using satellite imagery. A U-Net model with ResNet-34 encoder is trained on the LEVIR-CD dataset I used PyTorch Segmentation-Models-Pytorch for helping in to detect changes within 2 imagery and seeing the mask image to improve error and predict accurate change mask image
